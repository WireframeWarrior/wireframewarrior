							<p>Fighting Chance is a video game where you control a giant robot and fight a giant monster in the middle of a futuristic city. The player must carefully watch the opponent’s actions and fight to a rhythm, making sure to dodge or block enemy attacks while getting their own punches in. Pacific Rim meets Punch-Out!!</p>

									<p><b>Fighting Chance:</b> A giant, humanoid mecha. It’s very agile and powerful for its size, but it has no weaponry so it uses its fists. It’s still in development, so this first fight is like a live field test. Its name represents both the pilot’s chance at being something greater, and humanity’s Fighting Chance against colossal threats.</p>
							
								</div>
								<div class="item">
									<p><b>Electrogator:</b> A colossal beast that wreaks havoc wherever it goes. Because it attacks with heavy ferocity and has a lot of health, the player must be careful and dodge often. The result of a secret Government experiment gone wrong, it retreated into the sea for many years. Its origin is not publicly known, but it was hard to hide its existence due to the damage it caused when it first escaped.</p>

							<h2>Art Direction & Graphics</h2>
							<p>The game's graphics are heavily influenced by Arc System Work's style of 3D. It looks 2D when paused, as if you were watching anime instead of playing a game. They rely heavily on the 2D plane of gameplay and know that their camera will always be in a side view. Fighting Chance is similar because the camera is also almost always in a fixed position, but has to rely on being viewed from behind the main character and in front of the enemy.</p>
							<p>Great care was put into the models to make sure that they would always achieve this look, for example, the topology and UV's of Electrogator are squared in a way that muscle outlines could be drawn in and look good no matter the distance from the camera.</p>
							
							
							<h2>Programming Process</h2>
							<p>The game is programmed in C# using the Unity Engine. I utilized a Game Design Document to lay out what was required for a Minimum Viable Product and to keep the project on track with deadlines. Some parts ended up being done much earlier or later than the dates as some features ended up being easier to implement, or sometimes some glitches needed to be fixed before proceeding to the next feature.</p>

							<p>I created storyboards to demonstrate how the game would play before starting development.</p>
